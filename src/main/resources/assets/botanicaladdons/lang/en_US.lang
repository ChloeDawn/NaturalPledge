botanicaladdons.entry.divinityIntro=Divine Faith
botanicaladdons.tagline.divinityIntro=Kneel before the gods
botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro0=Traces of divine work are evident in this world. &4Mana&0, for one. The stuff of magic isn't possibly made by mortal hand. It is only a question of how to connect with these gods.
botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro1=The &1Holy Symbol&0 is the needed artifact for this connection, with what seems to be a wild storm of unrealized potential. Although crafted of simple materials, it has a ready acceptance of other magic. This is the gate to the &3Divine&0, and can be used to forge direct connections in the form of a &1Priestly Emblem&0.
botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro2=A key to the zodiac
botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro3=The connection the &1Priestly Emblems&0 give you are strong, but don't contain the full power you can harness. An interface to channel the power of a god on earth is required, to allow you to fully command the power you have gained. This interface is the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, a device which can cast &3Divine&0 spells.
botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro4=Taking a level in Wizard
botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro5=Even then, some may not wish to bind themselves to a god, but instead to fight them. By oversaturating the connection between a priest and their follower with &4Mana&0, you can fully cut it off. This can be accomplished by holding a &1Mortalstone&0, which forces &4Mana&0 into the soul of anyone around you.
botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro6=The Kaj's weapon

botanicaladdons.entry.njord=Faith in Njord
botanicaladdons.tagline.njord=Wind, sea, and sky
botanicaladdons.page.njord0=The &4Vanir&0 god of the fluid elements, &3Njord&0, seems like a worthy choice for your faith. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body hydrophobic, rising above any kind of fluid. You also gain attacks with the force of the wind, barreling your foes back with your every hit.
botanicaladdons.page.njord1=At the doom of men he will come back

botanicaladdons.entry.idunn=Faith in Idunn
botanicaladdons.tagline.idunn=Life, spring, and immortality
botanicaladdons.page.idunn0=The &4Vanir&0 god of the living elements, &3Idunn&0, seems like a good choice to declare yourself for. Wielding her aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body naturally catalytic to the growth of trees, giving saplings around you an effect similar to &1Bonemeal&0. You can manually apply this affect by sneak-clicking with an empty hand.
botanicaladdons.page.idunn1=Ash sunk down of alfen race

botanicaladdons.entry.thor=Faith in Thor
botanicaladdons.tagline.thor=Thunder, strength, and wrath
botanicaladdons.page.thor0=The &4Æsir&0 god of the sky, &3Thor&0, seems like a powerful god to ally with. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body makes your body swift, similar to the &1Soujourner's Sash&0. When using axes, the closest thing you could find to a hammer, &3Thor&0 will add force to your hit, slowing down whatever poor mob is stricken.
botanicaladdons.page.thor1=In anger smite the earth

botanicaladdons.entry.heimdall=Faith in Heimdall
botanicaladdons.tagline.heimdall=Fate, travel, and color
botanicaladdons.page.heimdall0=The &4Æsir&0 god of the Bifrost, &3Heimdall&0, seems like an interesting god to channel. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your eyes see more vibrantly, seeing light even in the shadow. When carrying a &1Rod of the Bifrost&0, you leave a trail of rainbow &4Bifrost&0 below you, allowing you to run in the sky.
botanicaladdons.page.heimdall1=The warder of heaven

botanicaladdons.entry.heimdall=Faith in Heimdall
botanicaladdons.tagline.heimdall=Fate, travel, and color
botanicaladdons.page.heimdall0=The &4Æsir&0 god of the Bifrost, &3Heimdall&0, seems like an interesting god to channel. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your eyes see more vibrantly, seeing light even in the shadow. When carrying a &1Rod of the Bifrost&0, you leave a trail of rainbow &4Bifrost&0 below you, allowing you to run in the sky.

botanicaladdons.entry.focus=Focusing the Divine
botanicaladdons.tagline.focus=Spellcasting 101
botanicaladdons.page.focus0=The abilities the &1Priestly Emblems&0 give you are certainly great, but they almost feel like you're not drawing your divinity's full strength. An interface to channel the power of a god on earth is required, to allow you to fully command the power you have gained. To that end, you have made the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, a device which can cast &3Divine&0 spells.
botanicaladdons.page.focus1=Taking a level in Wizard

botanicaladdons.entry.awakening=The Ritual of Gaia III
botanicaladdons.tagline.awakening=Sight, Sound, Strength, Power, Glory, Speed!
botanicaladdons.page.awakening0=The ritual performed to face off against the soul of the Earth is a incredible challenge, which allows one to obtain &5Relics&0 and &1Gaia Spirits&0. As you fight, this ritual connects you to the &3Divine&0 by your struggles. So, maybe you could... invert that connection? Through that, you would force a fragment of the &3Divine&0 into your &1Priestly Emblem&0.
botanicaladdons.page.awakening1=By using &1Divine Ritual Cores&0, you can modify the &4Ritual of Gaia&0 to do just that. These devices focus the energy of the &3Divine&0 into the Guardian, giving it power as the ritual plays out. The moment you slay the &4Guardian&0, that focused energy will leap into your &1Priestly Emblem&0. The power you could gain from this connection is staggering.
botanicaladdons.page.awakening2=The Ritual of Gaia III
botanicaladdons.page.awakening3=Seek the center to change the world

botanicaladdons.entry.wellshit=Consequences of Power
botanicaladdons.tagline.wellshit=Hindsight is 20/20
botanicaladdons.page.wellshit0=The power you gained from the &3Divine Guardian&0 ritual was, indeed, grand, but it has drawbacks. For one, you can't seem to take off the imbued emblem. For another, someone wielding a &4Mortalstone&0 could kill you without a second thought, due to the disconnect between the &3Divine&0 and Mortality being so jarring. Perhaps you shouldn't leap into every ritual without researching consequences.
