botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro1=The &1Holy Symbol&0 is the needed artifact for this connection, with what seems to be a wild storm of unrealized potential. Although crafted of simple materials, it has a ready acceptance of other magic. This is the gate to the &3Divine&0, and can be used to forge direct connections in the form of a &1Priestly Emblem&0. Wearing one will grant you more knowledge in this section.
botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro2=A key to the zodiac
botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro3=The connection the &1Priestly Emblems&0 give you are strong, but don't contain the full power you can harness. An interface to channel the power of a god on earth is required, to allow you to fully command the power you have gained. This interface is the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, a device which can cast &3Divine&0 spells.
botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro4=Taking a level in Wizard
botanicaladdons.page.divinityIntro5=Even then, some may not wish to bind themselves to a god, but instead to fight them. By oversaturating the connection between a priest and their follower with &4Mana&0, you can fully cut it off.

It accelerates the caster in the direction they look, allowing for rudimentary flight. Any device that allows the user to glide seems an interesting combination with this.
botanicaladdons.page.njordSpells1=The second spell of &3Njord&0, &1Galeforce&0, is a general protection spell. Most beings and projectiles will be pushed back from the player, giving them a sphere of safety.
botanicaladdons.page.njordSpells2=The third spell of &3Njord&0, &1Sudden Gust&0, allows for corralling animals without harming them. The being the player looks at will be forced back when it's cast, as if the player had hit them.
botanicaladdons.page.njordSpells3=The final spell of &3Njord&0, &1Tempest Infusion&0, forces the strength of a storm into a shard of the sea, making &1Aquamarine&0. If you can somehow augment your emblem's power, the storm within the shard might be more potent.

botanicaladdons.tagline.idunn=Life, spring, and immortality
botanicaladdons.page.idunn0=The &4Vanir&0 god of the living elements, &3Idunn&0, seems like a good choice to declare yourself for. Wielding her aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body naturally catalytic to the growth of trees, giving saplings around you an effect similar to &1Bonemeal&0. You can manually apply this affect by sneak-clicking with an empty hand.

botanicaladdons.page.idunnSpells0=The first spell that &3Idunn&0's emblem grants, &1Shield of Roots&0, is a powerful protection spell. While you have the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, for half a minute you will be unable to move, take, or deal melee damage. Giving the &1Focus&0 to someone else in that time will treat them as if they had been the one to cast the spell.
botanicaladdons.page.idunnSpells1=The secgond and final spell of &3Idunn&0, &1Life Catalyst&0, forces power into livingwood, twisting it to become &1Soulroot&0. If you can somehow augment your emblem's power, the root's lifeforce might be more potent.

botanicaladdons.entry.thor=Faith in Thor
botanicaladdons.tagline.thor=Thunder, strength, and wrath
botanicaladdons.page.thor0=The &4Ã†sir&0 god of the sky, &3Thor&0, seems like a powerful god to ally with. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body makes your body swift, similar to the &1Soujourner's Sash&0. When using axes, the closest thing you could find to a hammer, &3Thor&0 will add force to your hit, slowing down whatever poor mob is stricken.
botanicaladdons.page.thor1=In anger smite the earth

botanicaladdons.entry.thorSpells=Battle Magic
botanicaladdons.tagline.thorSpells=The art of war
botanicaladdons.page.thorSpells0=The first spell that &3Thor&0's emblem grants, &1Lightning Strike&0, is a very simple lightning spell. Electricity will arc out of the caster, striking whatever they're looking at within 10 blocks. This won't do much unless you hit a mob, of course.
botanicaladdons.page.thorSpells1=The second spell of &3Thor&0, &1Thunder's Force&0, is a strength spell. While you have the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, for half a minute you will hit with over twice the force you'd normally wield. Giving the &1Focus&0 to someone else in that time will treat them as if they had been the one to cast the spell.
botanicaladdons.page.thorSpells2=The third spell of &3Thor&0, &1Chains of Iron&0, almost seems to intrude upon the domain of &4Movement magic&0. It pulls the mob you look at towards you, as if you were a magnet and it iron. The pulled mob becomes slow for ten seconds, making their escape much harder.
botanicaladdons.page.thorSpells3=The fourth spell of &3Thor&0, &1Hypercharge&0, forces electric energy into the air where it hits, creating a pocket of electric charge. Anyone foolish enough to walk into it will be
botanicaladdons.page.thorSpells4=The final spell of &3Thor&0, &1Thunder Infusion&0, forces power into regular iron, making &1Thundersteel&0. If you can somehow augment your emblem's power, the metal might be more potent.

botanicaladdons.tagline.heimdall=Fate, travel, and color
botanicaladdons.page.heimdall0=The &4Ã†sir&0 god of the Bifrost, &3Heimdall&0, seems like an interesting god to channel. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your eyes see more vibrantly, seeing light even in the shadow. When carrying a &1Rod of the Bifrost&0, you leave a trail of rainbow &4Bifrost&0 below you, allowing you to run in the sky.

botanicaladdons.page.heimdallSpells0=The first spell that &3Heimdall&0's emblem grants, &1Iridescent Tones&0, creates a resonating sound that vibrates with the essence of color. Casting it on any dye will crystallize it, converting it into &1Iridescent Crystal&0. This crystal acts as a higher-potency dye, able to colorize even things like dirt.
botanicaladdons.page.heimdallSpells1=The second spell of &3Heimdall&0, &1Wave of Bifrost&0, creates for you a safe haven. When you cast it, a sphere of &4Bifrost&0 will rise around you, stopping your fall and giving you temporary protection from anything around you.

botanicaladdons.page.star1=Find Polaris to find your way

botanicaladdons.entry.shard=Iridescent Shards
botanicaladdons.tagline.shard=Mana-powered dye

botanicaladdons.page.shard1=Double rainbows

botanicaladdons.entry.prism=Rod of the Prismatic Lake
botanicaladdons.tagline.prism=Rainbow lights
botanicaladdons.page.prism0=One particularly frustrating property of the &1Mana Lens: Flash&0 is its tendency to lock the color of a &1Mana Flash&0 immediately upon making it. Even if you want to make a rainbow &1Flash&0, you'll get one color. By using the power of the &1Rod of the Prismatic Lake&0, you can make that rainbow. It can be tinged with &1Phantom Ink&0, and dyed with any &4Iridescent&0 dye like leather armor.
botanicaladdons.page.prism1=All the colors of the wind

botanicaladdons.entry.irisDirt=Iridescent Dirt
botanicaladdons.tagline.irisDirt=Dirt in lots of colors
botanicaladdons.page.irisDirt0=Using the power of &4Iridescence&0, you can make dirt that shimmers every color of the rainbow. This mystical dirt is capable of growing trees and plants without water or a hoe. It can be converted back to regular dirt using a &1Pure Daisy&0.
botanicaladdons.page.irisDirt1=Beauty from the dross
botanicaladdons.page.irisDirt2=Using the &1Iridescent Sapling&0, you can create a variety of tree that grows in all the colors of &1Iridescent Dirt&0. This can be achieved simply by planting the sapling on any colored dirt and letting it grow.
botanicaladdons.page.irisDirt3=2x4s

botanicaladdons.entry.lamp=Iridescent Lantern
botanicaladdons.tagline.lamp=A power-level indicating light
botanicaladdons.page.lamp0=The &1Iridescent Lantern&0 glows with all the colors of the rainbow. While black in appearance when first set down, giving it a redstone signal will change its color. The higher the signal, the farther down the rainbow the color becomes.<br>If given a full-strength signal, the &1Iridescent Lantern&0 will glow throughout the vibrant rainbow.
botanicaladdons.page.lamp1=Disco ball

botanicaladdons.entry.fist=Fists of Thunder
botanicaladdons.tagline.fist=A weapon that gets better in pairs
botanicaladdons.page.fist0=The &1Fists of Thunder&0 are the standard weapons of any priest of &3Thor&0. One is formidable enough, acting like a quicker &1Iron Sword&0. If you have one on each hand, though, you can block with them as if they were a shield. They can be enchanted to make them heavier or lighter, changing their properties.
botanicaladdons.page.fist1=Stopping power

botanicaladdons.entry.seal=Sealing Oak
botanicaladdons.tagline.seal=Sound muffling tree
botanicaladdons.page.seal0=The &1Sealing Oak&0 dampens the effects of loud sounds around it, causing anything around it to sound strangely far away. With enough, it's nearly impossible to hear. Any of the blocks in one of these trees can seal sounds.
botanicaladdons.page.seal1=An extra utility
botanicaladdons.page.seal2=The planks work too

botanicaladdons.entry.thunder=Thunderous Oak
botanicaladdons.tagline.thunder=A lightning rod
botanicaladdons.page.thunder0=The &1Thunderous Oak&0 absorbs lightning that strikes around it, preventing it from harming or transforming anything at all. Any of the blocks in one of these trees can absorb lightning.
botanicaladdons.page.thunder1=Thor'll hate you
botanicaladdons.page.thunder2=The planks work too

botanicaladdons.entry.circuit=Circuitree
botanicaladdons.tagline.circuit=A redstone emitter
botanicaladdons.page.circuit0=The &1Circuitree&0 emits a redstone signal of a strength equal to the number of &1Circuitree&0 blocks consecutively above it. Any block from the tree can be used in the stack, including the sapling.
botanicaladdons.page.circuit1=I deeply apologize for the pun
botanicaladdons.page.circuit2=The planks work too

botanicaladdons.entry.calico=Calico Tree
botanicaladdons.tagline.calico=An explosion absorber
botanicaladdons.page.calico0=The &1Calico Tree&0 is so cat-like, it scares more than just creepers away, it actually scares off any explosion at all. Any block from the tree can be used for this, including the sapling.
botanicaladdons.page.calico1=Not a scratching post
botanicaladdons.page.calico2=The planks work too

botanicaladdons.entry.awakening=The Ritual of Gaia III
botanicaladdons.tagline.awakening=Sight, Sound, Strength, Power, Glory, Speed!
botanicaladdons.page.awakening0=The ritual performed to face off against the soul of the Earth is a incredible challenge, which allows one to obtain &5Relics&0 and &1Gaia Spirits&0. As you fight, this ritual connects you to the &3Divine&0 by your struggles. So, maybe you could... invert that connection. Through that, you would force a fragment of the &3Divine&0 into your &1Priestly Emblem&0.
botanicaladdons.page.awakening1=By using &1Divine Ritual Cores&0, you can modify the &4Ritual of Gaia&0 to do just that. These devices focus the energy of the &3Divine&0 into the Guardian, giving it power and health as the ritual plays out. The moment you slay the &4Guardian&0, that focused energy will leap into your &1Priestly Emblem&0. The power you could gain from this connection is staggering.
botanicaladdons.page.awakening2=The Ritual of Gaia III
botanicaladdons.page.awakening3=Seek the center to change the world

botanicaladdons.entry.wellshit=Consequences of Power
botanicaladdons.tagline.wellshit=Hindsight is 20/20
botanicaladdons.page.wellshit0=The power you gained from the &3Divine Guardian&0 ritual was grand, but it has drawbacks. For one, you can't take off the imbued emblem. For another, someone wielding a &4Mortalstone&0 could kill you easily, due to the disconnect between the &3Divine&0 and Mortality being so jarring. Holding one allows severing the connection, by tearing the emblem off, but the process is rather lethal.

botanicaladdons.entry.apple=Apples of Immortality
botanicaladdons.tagline.apple=Exactly what it says on the can
botanicaladdons.page.apple0=Now that you are fully connected to &3Idunn&0, you can begin to receive her divine gifts. The primary form of these gifts are apples of gold, which make the eater nearly immortal. They'll be resistant to most forms of damage.
botanicaladdons.page.apple1=Happiness literally grows on trees
botanicaladdons.page.apple2a=A simple brew, it mimics the &1Apple of Immortality&0. When taken, it has a similar effect, giving the individual a &4Immortality&0 effect.
botanicaladdons.page.apple2b=Gather the dragonballs, I need to make a wish

botanicaladdons.entry.mjolnir=Mjolnir the Crusher
botanicaladdons.tagline.mjolnir=A hammer that throws you forward
botanicaladdons.page.mjolnir0=Now that you are fully connected to &3Thor&0, you can begin to receive his divine gifts. These gifts come in the form of the &1Crusher&0, &1Mjolnir&0.

botanicaladdons.page.mjolnir1=It's not a boomerang

botanicaladdons.entry.fateHorn=The Horn of Fate
botanicaladdons.tagline.fateHorn=A horn that gives mobs existential crises
botanicaladdons.page.fateHorn0=Now that you are fully connected to &3Heimdall&0, you can begin to receive his divine gifts. These gifts come in the form of the &1Horn of Fate&0, &1Gjallerhorn&0. This horn's sound reveals a mob's fate to it, making it barely able to move while it comprehends what it has seen.
botanicaladdons.page.fateHorn1=Don't let the existential dread set in

botanicaladdons.entry.ascension=Arrows of Ascension
botanicaladdons.tagline.ascension=Arrows which remove weight
botanicaladdons.page.ascension0=Now that you are fully connected to &3Njord&0, you can begin to receive his divine gifts. These gifts come in the form of the &1Arrows of Ascension&0. These arrows remove the hit player's weight temporarily, causing the tiny fluctuations of the wind to push them up. While the arrow itself is not lethal, the resulting fall might be to the unprepared.
botanicaladdons.page.ascension1=Justice rains from above
botanicaladdons.page.ascension2=Making more (The arrow is not consumed)

botanicaladdons.entry.sapling=Iridescent Sapling
botanicaladdons.tagline.sapling=A really big carnation
botanicaladdons.page.sapling0=The &1Iridescent Sapling&0 has no true color of its own. Instead, it grows with whatever dirt is beneath it as a color. Not all dirt can be used in this way, including natural dirt. A good starting point is the special &1Pasture Seeds&0.
botanicaladdons.page.sapling1=Deconstruction but no reconstruction

botanicaladdons.entry.funnel=Livingwood Funnel
botanicaladdons.tagline.funnel=A single-slot hopper
botanicaladdons.page.funnel0=For some people, the &1Hopper&0 is too lax. It allows items through when it shouldn't, and sometimes moves them too fast. The &1Livingwood Funnel&0 is far, far stricter. It only allows one item through at a time, and can be filtered by placing an &1Item Frame&0 on one of its sides. Its contents can be seen by looking at it while holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0.
botanicaladdons.page.funnel1=London loves queues

botanicaladdons.entry.amp=Sonic Amplifier
botanicaladdons.tagline.amp=Louder sounds
botanicaladdons.page.amp0=By dampening the sounds of the air within &1Note Blocks&0, the &1Sonic Amplifier&0 can reverberate sound, making sounds within a block or two sound far louder. The more you have, the louder the sound.
botanicaladdons.page.amp1=Don't whisper

botanicaladdons.entry.crackle=Crackling Stars
botanicaladdons.tagline.crackle=An unstable light source
botanicaladdons.page.crackle0=The &1Crackling Star&0 is the form of the stars, trapped upon earth, and brought forth through &4Iridescence&0. They appear as a ball of light, but will distribute their mass to nearby &1Crackling Stars&0. They give off light with the same strength as &1Glowstone&0, and can be made in any of the colors of &4Iridescence&0.
botanicaladdons.page.crackle1=Wire's frames

botanicaladdons.entry.ironBelt=Weighted Belt
botanicaladdons.tagline.ironBelt=Prevents floating
botanicaladdons.page.ironBelt0=While waterwalking is nice, sometimes a priest of &3Njord&0 needs to walk on the bottom of the ocean. While sneaking can work, it's sometimes nicer to just sink. The &1Weighted Belt&0 will drag you down in air, and prevent waterwalking.
botanicaladdons.page.ironBelt1=Fancier cement shoes

botanicaladdons.entry.xpTome=Tome of the Ages
botanicaladdons.tagline.xpTome=Break down enchantments
botanicaladdons.page.xpTome0=Enchantments rarely go exactly as planned, and using &1Spellbinding Cloth&0 doesn't give anything back. The &1Tome of the Ages&0 transfers one enchantment at a time into the ancient collective knowledge of the forests, and releases the experience of the enchantment, which can be retrieved with a simple use of the book. Sneak-using the book will steal your experience, allowing you to store it, if imperfectly.
botanicaladdons.page.xpTome1=All hail the second Eaton

botanicaladdons.entry.corporeaRecall=Remote Corporea
botanicaladdons.tagline.corporeaRecall=Request items from a Corporea network remotely
botanicaladdons.page.corporeaRecall0=The &1Corporea Resonator&0 and its counterpart, the &1Stone of Recall&0, allow for accessing a corporea network from far away. If you bind a &1Stone&0 to a &1Resonator&0 as if it was a &1Waystone&0, holding the Stone will allow you to trigger the &1Resonator&0 as if it was a &1Corporea Index&0, dropping the results as if it was a &1Corporea Funnel&0.
botanicaladdons.page.corporeaRecall1=Let's Go! Soul Resonance!
botanicaladdons.page.corporeaRecall2=I can't remember...

botanicaladdons.entry.enderActuator=Ender Actuator
botanicaladdons.tagline.enderActuator=Control your Ender Chest remotely
botanicaladdons.page.enderActuator0=The &1Ender Actuator&0 is an interesting block, allowing resonance with your &4Ender Chest&0 from across the world. To activate one, click a disabled one and it will begin to shine. As long as you are in the same dimension as a bound &1Actuator&0, it will act as an interface for your &4Ender Chest&0 for machines to use.
botanicaladdons.page.enderActuator1=Not a tessaract
