botanicaladdons.entry.holySymbol=Divine Faith
botanicaladdons.tagline.holySymbol=Kneel before the gods
botanicaladdons.page.holySymbol0=Traces of divine work are evident in this world. &4Mana&0, for one. The stuff of magic can't possibly be made by mortal hand. The question, then, is how to connect with these gods. However, it might be possible, even with mundane materials.
botanicaladdons.page.holySymbol1=The &1Holy Symbol&0 is the needed artifact, with what seems to be a wild storm of unrealized potential. Although crafted of simple materials, it has a ready acceptance of other magic. Perhaps this can be our gate to the &3Divine&0.
botanicaladdons.page.holySymbol2=A key to the zodiac

botanicaladdons.entry.njord=Faith in Njord
botanicaladdons.tagline.njord=Wind, sea, and sky
botanicaladdons.page.njord0=The &4Vanir&0 god of the fluid elements, &3Njord&0, seems like a worthy choice for your faith. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body hydrophobic, rising above any kind of fluid. You also gain attacks with the force of the wind, barreling your foes back with your every hit.
botanicaladdons.page.njord1=At the doom of men he will come back

botanicaladdons.entry.idunn=Faith in Idunn
botanicaladdons.tagline.idunn=Life, spring, and immortality
botanicaladdons.page.idunn0=The &4Vanir&0 god of the living elements, &3Idunn&0, seems like a good choice to declare yourself for. Wielding her aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body naturally catalytic to the growth of trees, giving saplings around you an effect similar to &1Bonemeal&0. You can manually apply this affect by sneak-clicking with an empty hand.
botanicaladdons.page.idunn1=Ash sunk down of alfen race

botanicaladdons.entry.thor=Faith in Thor
botanicaladdons.tagline.thor=Thunder, strength, and wrath
botanicaladdons.page.thor0=The &4Ã†sir&0 god of the sky, &3Thor&0, seems like a powerful god to ally with. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body makes your body swift, similar to the &1Soujourner's Sash&0. When using axes, the closest thing you could find to a hammer, &3Thor&0 will add force to your hit, slowing down whatever poor mob is stricken.
botanicaladdons.page.thor1=In anger smite the earth

botanicaladdons.entry.awakening=The Ritual of Gaia III
botanicaladdons.tagline.awakening=Sight, Sound, Strength, Power, Glory, Speed!
botanicaladdons.page.awakening0=The ritual performed to face off against the soul of the Earth is a incredible challenge, which allows one to obtain &5Relics&0 and &1Gaia Spirits&0. As you fight, this ritual connects you to the &3Divine&0 by your struggles. So, maybe you could... invert that connection? Through that, you would force a fragment of the &3Divine&0 into your &1Priestly Emblem&0.
botanicaladdons.page.awakening1=By using &1Divine Ritual Cores&0, you can modify the &4Ritual of Gaia&0 to do just that. These devices focus the energy of the &3Divine&0 into the Guardian, giving it power as the ritual plays out. The moment you slay the &4Guardian&0, that focused energy will leap into your &1Priestly Emblem&0. The power you could gain from this connection is staggering.

botanicaladdons.page.awakening3=Seek the center to change the world

botanicaladdons.entry.wellshit=Consequences of Power
botanicaladdons.tagline.wellshit=Hindsight is 20/20
botanicaladdons.page.wellshit0=The power you gained from the &3Divine Guardian&0 ritual was, indeed, grand, but it has drawbacks. For one, you can't seem to take off the imbued emblem. For another, someone wielding a &4Mortalstone&0 could kill you without a second thought, due to the disconnect between the &3Divine&0 and Mortality being so jarring. Perhaps you shouldn't leap into every ritual without researching consequences.
